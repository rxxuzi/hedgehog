# Channel example
# Demonstrates buffered channel communication

# Create a channel
^= ch @ci

# Send values
-> $ch 10
-> $ch 20
-> $ch 30

# Receive and print
~> <- $ch
~> <- $ch
~> <- $ch

# Channel with computation
^= calc @ci
-> $calc .* 6 7
~> <- $calc

# Multiple channels
^= ch1 @ci
^= ch2 @ci
-> $ch1 "hello"
-> $ch2 "world"
~> <- $ch1
~> <- $ch2
